# The Epic of MOAgent: The League of Cerebras

## Act I: The Call to Adventure

Once upon a time, deep in the bustling kingdom of Source, there lived an aspiring app called the **Mixture of Agents Demo** (MOA Demo). Though small and humble in appearance, MOA Demo’s dreams were mighty: to orchestrate many powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) in perfect harmony, and bring forth answers so wise, they would stun even the sages of Stack Overflow!

But MOA Demo did not travel alone. It relied on the ancient, silicon-bending magic of **Cerebras**, summoning LLM titans like *llama-3.3-70b*, *llama3.1-8b*, *llama-4-scout-17b*, and *qwen-3-32b*. Together, they formed the legendary **League of Cerebras**.

## Act II: Trials, Triumphs, and Disastrous Debugging

Guided by the noble `MOAgent`, an entity as strict as a Pydantic model and as omniscient as a config file, the League ventured into the Land of User Queries.

Every query would summon a mighty adventure: the Layer Agents would leap into action, each specializing in a different magical art (logic, randomness, and step-by-step wisdom, plus good old JSON wrangling). Wreathed in system prompts and wrapped in the robes of their Temperatures, they argued, reasoned, opined, and—sometimes—accidentally hallucinated about crocodiles living in kitchen sinks.

But woe to the query that was ambiguous! For the League, even with their Reference System Prompts, could split into confusion, entering infinite loops of deliberation, producing 500 errors that echoed across the Console Abyss.

## Act III: The Orchestration Showdown

In the epicenter of Source, the archvillain **Zero Determinism** appeared, threatening the reliability of LLM outputs everywhere. The League’s ultimate test: to combine their layer agent insights into a single, unified, reality-aligned truth. Main Model, donning the SYSTEM_PROMPT like armor, would synthesize the League’s chaos into sense.

Thunderous API calls erupted! Real-time streaming unfurled across the land! The `concat_responses` spell and the `chat()` prophecy echoed bravely from the gates of Streamlit UI. The battle was fierce, and many a bug perished beneath the sword called Requirements.txt.

## Act IV: Return Home—and Contribute!

At last, with Zero Determinism banished and accurate answers restored, the MOA Demo looked to the horizon. “There will always be new user queries,” it mused, polishing its LICENSE for good luck. “But with the teamwork of Llama, Qwen, and the undying power of Cerebras, there is nothing we cannot debug!”

Thus MOA Demo, with its artifacts LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, and README, welcomed new heroes to the fold—adventurers willing to fork, build, and test. For this was not the end—only the beginning of a continuous deployment pipeline.

**THE END… Or is it just the next commit?**
