# Building a simple agent with Dagger

Made having fun at the [Build-an-Agent Hack Night](https://lu.ma/nb9ss3s7?tk=csvqrX). 

In fact, this is a simple use-case of a Dagger CLI.


## Prepared project
The project aims to build a simple agent that can write a story about a code base, as a more funny & engaging way of generating code documentation.

The agent's definition is in the [.dagger/src/story_teller_agent/main.py](.dagger/src/story_teller_agent/main.py) file. Basically this is the only source code modified during the hack night, everything else is boilerplate code [generated by Dagger CLI](https://docs.dagger.io/quickstart/agent#initialize-a-dagger-module).


## The results

Here are the example stories generated based on the few repositories:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [story-cognitive-lens.md](results/story-cognitive-lens.md) |[vonHousen/cognitive-lens](https://github.com/vonHousen/cognitive-lens) |
| [story-moa.md](results/story-moa.md) | [vonHousen/cerebras-moa](https://github.com/vonHousen/cerebras-moa) |


## Running the project

Refer to the [Dagger CLI documentation](https://docs.dagger.io/quickstart/agent#run-the-agent) for more details. 

Assuming the dagger CLI is installed & docker running, first open the dagger shell:
```bash
dagger
```

and then run the agent & open the shell within the agent's container to access the story:
```bash
write-story "https://github.com/vonHousen/cognitive-lens" | terminal
```

Voila!
